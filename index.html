                <i>The glitter of Venice’s lights hides a dark truth: when the floodwaters rise, no one is safe.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Koru knows better than to trust anyone but her own. Hidden deep in the winding
                twists of Venice’s narrow alleys, Koru and her found family must disguise themselves to
                survive. They are Rhunlokni, an ethnic minority gifted with the ability to channel the
                power of the Earth, their Goddess. They have long been vilified and prosecuted for their
                strange abilities—and Koru’s gift is the strongest of her generation.
            <p>
                So when the police arrive in St. Mark’s Square to arrest Koru for a crime she
                didn’t commit, she does the only thing she can—she runs. Though Koru manages to
                escape the police, a larger threat is drawing near. Koru must figure out what the Goddess
                is trying to tell her, protect those she loves, and uncover the truth of her past before it’s
                too late—because Venice is sinking. Tonight.
